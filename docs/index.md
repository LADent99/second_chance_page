### Matching <a name="matching"></a>
Our matching system consists of 4 seperate states.
1. Not Matched - Your default state with any user.  No connection between you two has been made    
  **TODO: INSERT IMAGE**
2. Pending Match, Outgoing - You have requested a match with this user.  You can either rescend the request or wait for them to accept    
  **TODO: INSERT IMAGE**
3. Pending Match, Incoming - You have recieved a match from this user.  You can either leave it pending and not accept, not creating a match, or you can accept and create a match with this user.

4. Currently Matched - You are matched with this user.  In the future you will be able to message and exchange information
